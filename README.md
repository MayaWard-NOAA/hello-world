# hello-world
my learning github repository

Hello fellow coders! 

I'm learning how to use GitHub and hoping it can help me with future projects. I like the beach, sunshine, pesto, and peanut butter. 
Don't like coffee but wish I could drink caffeine to pick me up. 
Have a wonderful day! Find one good thing in it.
